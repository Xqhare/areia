# areia
Protect and conceal your application data with areia. This zero-dependency Rust crate manages hidden config and state directories across Windows, Linux, and macOS, handling platform-specific hiding logic (metadata vs. dotfiles) automatically. Like the nymph who hid her son in vines, areia keeps your data safe and unseen.
